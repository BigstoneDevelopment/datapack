# **What is Bigstone?**
**Bigstone is a custom redstone-like system where components are supersized to a 16x16x16 block scale. Each Bigstone component simulates its function using regular redstone.**

While scaling redstone components to larger sizes like this isn’t a new idea, Bigstone goes further by:
- Adding unique functionality to familiar components
- Introducing entirely new types of components (heavy repeaters, chain lamps, dust bridges, etc...)
- Following a consistent set of design rules to make components compatible with each other

At this point, it’s no longer just “big redstone”, which is why I call it Bigstone!
