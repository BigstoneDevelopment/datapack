# Port Standards

All ports will be named in this format:

`[DIR][TYPE]-[#PORTS][ROLE]`

How the format works:

[DIR] - Can be either an Input, Output, or Bidirectional port (Labelled I, O or B)
[TYPE] - BIN (Binary) / HEX (Hexadecimal)
[#PORTS] - The number of ports it has, as a number. If it has 1 port, you don't have to include this tag!
[ROLE] - Most ports will be SD (Standard), but ports with specific roles will have different colors and have a different named tag. There are none yet, but this will change soon (eventually). If the port is SD you don't have to include this tag!

# PORT COLORS

Each port would have a corresponding colored concrete block under it. 
Here's the current list of all official ports:
BIN-SD: ðŸŸ¥ Red
HEX-SD: ðŸŸ¦ Light Blue

# PORT MEANINGS

BIN-SD: The default port. Used to connect redblocks together, and is the most simplest (as it does not preserve signal strength)
HEX-SD: A more advanced port. They preserve the signal strength from the output of the previous block. Useful for HEX calculations.

What do you think of this? It's a simple system to understand, while still giving detail (I wrote this myself btw)

Edit: Fixed some formatting mistakes :P
Edit 2: Added [#PORTS]
